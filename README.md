Computational physics simulations for the NASA/ESA asteroid deflection mission DART/Hera in 2022: 
https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Hera

## Motivation
If [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo) Meteor had come down over Paris instead of Siberia, the DART/Hera mission would have even more more funding. 

## Tech used
All simulations are done with [miluphcuda](https://github.com/christophmschaefer/miluphcuda), a [Smoothed particle hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) code capable of parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Credits
[miluphcuda](https://github.com/christophmschaefer/miluphcuda) is build and maintained mainly by Christoph Schaefer in the computational physics group ([CPT](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/physik/institute/astronomie-astrophysik/institut/computational-physics/willkommen/)) at the University of Tuebingen.

## A last note
If [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq02C_3FvFo) Meteor had come down over Paris instead of Siberia, the DART/Hera mission would have even more more funding...
