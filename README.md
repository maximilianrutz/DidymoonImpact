# DidymoonImpact
Computational physics simulations for the NASA/ESA asteroid deflection mission DART/Hera in 2022: 
https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Hera

## Motivation
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Tech used
All simulations are done with [miluphcuda](https://github.com/christophmschaefer/miluphcuda), a [Smoothed particle hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) code capable of parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs

## Credits
[Miluphcuda](https://github.com/christophmschaefer/miluphcuda) is build and maintained mainly by Christoph Schaefer in the computational physics group CPT at the University of Tuebingen.
