- beta factor lower than Raducan grid based but comparable to Stickle SPH
- upper limit beta below 2 because of momentum conservation?? -- which inertial system is used for calculation of beta factor in other papers?
- tensorial correction not implemented because of timestep getting to small
- no real boundary conditions implemented
- the whole target shows shift (should not be a problem since we are still in the inertial frame of rest of the target !?)
