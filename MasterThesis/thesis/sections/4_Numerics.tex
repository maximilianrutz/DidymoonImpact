\subsection{Initial conditions}
- SPH needs uniform macro structure but random micro structure


\subsection{SPH - Right hand side quantities}
- how are the equations from Theory section used to get the development over time
- final form of Equation we used:
.........................
- Neighborhoudsearch instead of computing Kernel over all particles is faster
- Upper limit to maximum neighbor particles


\subsection{Time Integration}
1) Timestep algorithm for velocity update (RungeKutta 2)
2) Update particle positions from velocity and acceleration (accel from Navier Stokes)
3) Error criterium for timestep (what is used? RK45?)
