\subsection{Conservation laws}



Results
- include cratering for 45 degree
- explain calculation of beta factor
- along impact direction also for 45 degree
- particles near surface not important because of lorenz curve, every particle has constant mass(?)
-

Discussion:
- why does beta rise again for Y=1MPa?
- no rise for 45 degree impact
- overall a lot less difference between strengths and porosities than other research groups
